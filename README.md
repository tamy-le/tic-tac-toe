# Dynamic Tic Tac Toe

In a personal endeavor to deepen my understanding of modern web development frameworks, I set out to challenge myself: to learn and apply Next.js and Tailwind CSS in building a familiar game, Tic-Tac-Toe, all within a single day. This project not only served as a rapid learning exercise but also as a way to demonstrate the practical application of these technologies in a fun, interactive context.


## Project Overview
- **Dynamic Grid Size:** Offers flexibility in gameplay with a configurable grid size, ranging from 3x3 to 10x10, allowing for varying levels of difficulty and strategy.
- **Interactive Game Play:** Players can click on squares to make their moves, with the game automatically alternating between 'X' and 'O'.
- **Win Detection Logic:** Sophisticated algorithms check for win conditions across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, dynamically adjusting to the grid size and highlighting the winning sequence.
- **Move History Tracking:** Every move is recorded, enabling players to review the game's progression. This feature adds a strategic depth, allowing players to backtrack and analyze past moves.
- **Reversible Moves Order:** A toggle feature to reverse the order of the move history, enhancing the analysis and review of the game strategy.
- **Game Status Updates:** Real-time updates on the game's status, indicating whose turn it is, who won, or if the game ended in a draw, keeping players informed throughout the game.
